# Data Structure Project

## Overview
This project explores fundamental data structures and their practical applications. It includes implementations, use cases, and performance analyses to help understand how different data structures work and when to use them effectively.

---

## Project Objectives
1. Provide clear and efficient implementations of fundamental data structures.
2. Demonstrate the use cases and applications for each data structure.
3. Analyze and compare the performance of different data structures.

---

## Implemented Data Structures
1. **Arrays and Linked Lists**
   - Dynamic arrays
   - Singly and doubly linked lists
2. **Stacks and Queues**
   - Stack (array and linked list implementations)
   - Queue (standard and circular queue)
3. **Trees and Graphs**
   - Binary search tree (BST)
   - AVL tree
   - Graphs (adjacency list and matrix representations)
4. **Hash Tables**
   - Open addressing
   - Separate chaining
5. **Heaps**
   - Min-heap and max-heap
