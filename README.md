Overview
This project implements various data structure operations, focusing on merging data from two structures of the same type. It provides solutions for arrays, singly linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees. Users can interactively select the type of data structure they wish to merge.

Features
Merging Two Arrays
Merging Two Singly Linked Lists
Merging Two Stacks
Merging Two Queues
Merging Two Binary Trees
Each merging operation retains the integrity of the original data structures and provides a resultant merged structure.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later.
IDE or text editor to run Java programs (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

Installation
Clone this repository or download the source files.
Ensure all .java files are in the same package directory.
Compile and run Data_structure_project.java to start the program.

Usage
Run the main program (Data_structure_project.java).
Choose the data structure type you want to merge from the menu.
Enter the sizes and elements of the two data structures when prompted.
View the merged result.
Example for merging arrays:


**Welcome to the Data structure Merging Assignment**
Please select one of the following options:
1: Merging two Arrays data structure type
2: Merging two Single Linked Lists data structure type
3: Merging two Stacks data structure type
4: Merging two Queues data structure type
5: Merging two Trees data structure type
Your selection is: 1
Please enter The first Data set's size: 3
Please enter The First Data set elements:
1 2 3
Please enter The Second Data set's size: 2
Please enter The Second Data set elements:
4 5
The Resultant Merged Arrays: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
